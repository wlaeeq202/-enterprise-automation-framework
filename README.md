## 🧩 Enterprise Data Simulation (Snowflake-Style ETL)

This repository includes a **deterministic, CI-safe simulation of a Snowflake ETL pipeline**.

It demonstrates how an SDET validates **data correctness and performance**, not just UI or API responses.

### 🔄 What the ETL Workflow Does

1. Generate representative raw data (5,000 rows)
2. Transform raw → fact output (GROUP BY + SUM)
3. Independently re-aggregate raw data
4. Compare expected vs actual results
5. Measure execution runtime
6. Fail CI if:
   - Data mismatches are detected
   - Runtime regression exceeds allowed threshold

## ⏱ Runtime Regression Protection

In addition to validating data correctness, the ETL pipeline also protects
against **performance regressions**.

### How Runtime Is Evaluated

- ETL execution time is measured during CI
- A historical baseline is used when available
- Safe defaults are applied when no baseline exists

### Why CI Uses 5,000 Rows (and Not Millions)

HealthMonix-style pipelines can process **millions of rows**, but CI must stay fast.

This repo intentionally uses **5,000 representative rows** in PR builds to:
- Catch ETL logic regressions quickly (GROUP BY / SUM rules)
- Keep pull request pipelines fast and reliable
- Prevent deployments from slowing down due to validation suites

### How This Scales to Millions

The same scripts work for larger datasets by changing an environment variable:

- PR / CI: `ROWS=5000` (fast correctness + quick runtime signal)
- Nightly / scheduled: `ROWS=100000+` (heavier performance validation)

This is the same strategy enterprise teams use:
**fast correctness checks per commit + scheduled performance gates**
