    steps:
      # Step 1: Pull down your repo code onto the GitHub runner VM
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Node (match your local environment)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      # Step 3: Install dependencies exactly as locked in package-lock.json
      # npm ci is faster + deterministic for CI
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Generate a representative dataset
      # IMPORTANT: In real HealthMonix flows there are millions of rows,
      # but CI should be fast. We validate correctness on 5k rows here.
      - name: Generate raw data (simulated Excel upload)
        run: npm run etl:generate
        env:

      # Step 5: Transform raw data into a Snowflake-style fact output
      - name: Transform to fact table output
        run: npm run etl:transform

      # Step 6: Validate correctness (fail the build if mismatch)
      - name: Validate transformation
        run: npm run etl:validate

      # Step 7: Upload output JSON files as artifacts
      # Helpful when CI fails, so you can download and inspect quickly.
